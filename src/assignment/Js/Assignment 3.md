# Js Assignment 1
### Write the Code for all Data types
String.
```
let str= "Zia"
console.log(typeof str) // String
```
Number.
```
let num= 123
console.log(typeof num) // Number
```
Bigint.

Boolean.
```
let bool= true
console.log(typeof bool) // Boolean
```
Undefined.

```
let person
console.log(typeof person) // Boolean
```
Null.
```
let person=null
```
Symbol.
```
let sym = Symbol('description')
console.log(typeof sym)
```
Object.
```
let person ={name:"Ziya" , age:18}
console.log(typeof person)
```

### What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?

Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more. There are different types of JavaScript operators: Arithmetic Operators.

### Explain the Assignment Operator.
The assignment operator = assigns the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a property given by its left-hand operand. The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned to the left-hand operand.

### All arthmetic operator in javascript with little example.
1. Addition (+)
```
let sum = 5 + 3;
console.log(sum); // Output: 8
```
2. Subtraction (-)
```
let difference = 10 - 4;
console.log(difference); // Output: 6

```
3. Multiplication (*)
```
let product = 7 * 2;
console.log(product); // Output: 14
```
4. Division (/)
```
let quotient = 20 / 5;
console.log(quotient); // Output: 4
```
5. Modulus (%)
```
let remainder = 15 % 4;
console.log(remainder); // Output: 3 (remainder of 15 divided by 4)

```
6. Exponentiation **
```
let power = 2 ** 3;
console.log(power); // Output: 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
```
7. Increment (++) and Decrement (--)
```
let x = 5;
x++;
console.log(x); // Output: 6

let y = 8;
y--;
console.log(y); // Output: 7

```

### What are the Binary Operators in js ?
Binary operators in JavaScript are operators that operate on two operands. Here are some common binary operators in JavaScript.

1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Comparison Operators
3.Logical Operators
4.Assignment Operators
5.Bitwise Operators
6.String Concatenation

### Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.
1.Pre-Increment (++)
In pre-increment, the value of the variable is incremented before its current value is used in an expression.
```
let x = 5;
let y = ++x;

console.log(x); // Output: 6
console.log(y); // Output: 6

```
2.Post-Increment (++)
```
let a = 10;
let b = a++;

console.log(a); // Output: 11
console.log(b); // Output: 10

```
